### ABOUT TOMMY'S SCRIPTINATOR 3000 TM ###

author: Tommy Clausner

Tommy’s Scriptinator 3000 TM aims to provide an interface between code line programming 
and grafical user interfaces. This can become especially handy in science, where users in 
general are less skilled in using multiple programming languages. E.g. students entering 
the field are often confronted with analysis scripts that are stiched together by another 
person and spend often a significant amount of time figuring out the workflow. This is 
where Tommy’s Scriptinator 3000 TM slips in.

This project served as the final project for "Introduction to Java for Bioinformatics" 
summer semester 2018 Radound University Nijmegen.

Teacher: Arthur Pistorius

remark for those who need it:

Tommy's Scriptinator 3000 TM is not a registered trade mark. The name is a funny reference 
to the computer game "Thimbleweed Park".
